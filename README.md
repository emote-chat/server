## Database Setup for UNIX-based Systems
<!-- remove next two steps later because we'll want to seed the database as part of running the server locally in 'development' mode -->

1. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) **major version 11**. We recommend using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
1. Switch to the postgres UNIX account: `sudo -i -u postgres`
1. Create a username and password (replace `username` with desired username): `createuser username --pwprompt`
1. Enter password to be used for the user you just created
1. To create a database (replace `database` with desired database name): `createdb database`
1. To exit the postgres UNIX account: `exit`
1. Create a file named `.env` at the root of the project with the variables in `.env.example` and replace with the host, user, user password and database information for the databases you'll be using for development and testing respectively. `DEV_DB_HOST` and `TEST_DB_HOST` default to `localhost` so you don't have to include those variables if you plan to use `localhost`. It is suggested that you specify separate tables for `DEV_DB_NAME` and `TEST_DB_NAME` since the test suites will wipe the test database clean before running each test suite. *Please note that production database information is only accessible to the project owners.*

## Run Server

OS X, Linux and Windows:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Run Tests
```sh
npm install
npm test
```

## NLP 

### Installation

1. Don't forget to define `TWITTER_USER`, `TWITTER_PASS`, `TWITTER_KEY` and `TWITTER_SECRET` in your `.env` file. *Refer to the `.env.example` to be sure you define the necessary environment variables.*
1. If planning to get more data using a twitter stream, download [this ChromeDriver zip file](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=74.0.3729.6/), unzip it and copy the executable into the `nlp` directory.
1. Update and activate the Anaconda virtual env:

```sh
conda env update -f nlp/env.yml --prune
conda activate emote
```

### Get More Data
* To use twitter stream (live tweets; *note that you must have [Twitter login verification](https://twitter.com/settings/account) (2-factor authentication) temporarily turned off* as the script uses your username and password to authenticate you along with your app key and secret to acquire the proper oauth v1.0 credentials &mdash; v2.0 is not available for streams):

```sh
python nlp/twitter.py
```

* To use twitter search and get 100 tweets at a time:

```sh
python nlp/twitter.py -se
```

## Read Tweets Pickle
```sh
python nlp/read.py
```

## Process Tweets Pickle
```sh
python nlp/process.py
```

<!-- ## Usage example -->

<!-- A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._ -->

<!-- ## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
``` -->
